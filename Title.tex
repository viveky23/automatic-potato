\textcolor{red}{{\bf Abstract} (This course surveys the leading computational frameworks for understanding human intelligence and cognition. Both psychologists and data scientists are working with increasingly large quantities of human behavioral data. Computational cognitive modeling aims to understand behavioral data and the mind and brain, more generally, by building computational models of the cognitive processes that produce the data. This course introduces the goals, philosophy, and technical concepts behind computational cognitive modeling. The lectures cover artificial neural networks (deep learning), reinforcement learning, Bayesian modeling, model comparison and fitting, classification, probabilistic graphical models, and program induction. Modeling examples span a broad set of psychological abilities including learning, categorization, language, memory, decision making, and reasoning.)
